# corbanbrook-js
Real valued split radix FFT with inverse.

Install: `npm install corbanbrook-js`

Example usage for `corbanbrook-js` can be found in the test directory.

This is a partial fork of dsp.js by @corbanbrook which is no longer maintained.
It's partial in the sense that I've only taken the real valued FFT.  
  
Special mention to @Spudd86 for his pull request which contained the
working inverse tranform which is also included here.

Special mention also to Henrik Sorensen who I suspect is two transpiles behind
this code in FORTRAN.
 
The original dsp.js is [here](https://github.com/corbanbrook/dsp.js/).
